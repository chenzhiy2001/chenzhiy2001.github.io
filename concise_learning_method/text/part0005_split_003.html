<h4 class="h4a" id="calibre_pb_5">Complaints, Complaints, and More Complaints</h4>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00024.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="noindent">For nearly a decade, I’ve taught college chemistry at various institutions. While teaching, I always did my best to give students guidance and direction. Regardless of where I taught, at two-year community colleges or prestigious four-year universities, students expressed similar complaints:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">Information overload.</li>
<li class="calibre10">Inability to learn the required information.</li>
<li class="calibre10">Not enough time to get anything done right.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paraspaceabove">These complaints didn’t surprise me. After all, I’ve seen first-hand how students are expected to learn more at ever increasing rates. Helping students overcome the dilemma of balancing time constraints and daunting amounts of information with true learning became my central mission while teaching.</p>

<h4 class="h2">What Works and What Doesn’t, According to Students</h4>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00026.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="noindent">As I set out to develop a learning method that was both effective (increasing what you learn) and efficient (learning quickly and with minimal effort), I recruited from the experts — students themselves. Before asking them a single question, however, I made it clear that all students can be effective and efficient learners; it’s just a matter of learning how to learn. Given that fundamental premise, their responses transitioned from complaints to recommendations. Their insight into what works and what doesn’t work provided the foundation for my learning method.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">My experience with students shows that the most significant difference between struggling students and highly successful ones is that struggling students get bogged down in unfocused and unproductive reading, copying, and repetition, instead of focusing on key concepts and the pursuit of a complete picture, which really drives successful learning.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00028.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00029.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">With so much to learn, you simply can’t absorb everything. Some information will be lost. What’s really important is that you have control over what information gets lost and what gets retained.</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre8">Struggling students:</strong> Rather than aiming for learning, they are preoccupied with trying to absorb all information. Because the information never gets processed into long-term memory but simply gets dumped into short-term memory, their brains get overwhelmed and subconsciously filter out much of the information, including the most important things.</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre8">Highly successful students:</strong> They apply an information filter early in the learning process because they know they can’t possibly absorb all of the information presented, nor do they have to. They select what is important to learn. They make a conscious decision to absorb only the key concepts, which in turn enables them to learn the course material better and faster and to be able to apply it to other areas of learning as well.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00030.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/></p>
<h4 class="h2">Everyone Can Be an Excellent Student</h4>
<p class="paraspaceabove">From students’ responses, it is apparent that being an excellent learner is an acquired skill. It’s all about the learning method and your skills, not your innate ability. No one is born knowing how to learn, and most students are never taught how to learn, so it’s no wonder that trial-and-error studying prevails.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00031.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">Many students just need a better approach to learning to be successful — a less linear, more effective method. The Concise Learning method is that better approach.</p>
<h3 class="h1"><a id="sec1-009" class="calibre1"></a>1.2 CLM: In a Nutshell</h3>
<h4 class="h2">CLM: The Overview</h4>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00032.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="noindent-new">In CLM, you treat the subject of interest as a puzzle you’re trying to solve. Since real-life puzzles don’t come in neat boxes with the final picture and all the pieces, you need to ask some key questions about existing and missing pieces. As you find the missing pieces, you then organize and connect them with existing pieces, an activity that requires critical thinking.</p>
<p class="noindent">CLM is a visual, flexible, meaningful, and systematic approach to effective and efficient learning through the use of an active, cognitive, inquiry-based, and constructive process. CLM enables you to break free from passive and dull memorization.</p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">With CLM, <strong class="calibre8">learning is achieved via a five-phase process</strong> (looking for puzzle pieces) <strong class="calibre8">that involves meaningfully organizing and connecting key concepts in a visual map</strong> (putting together the puzzle pieces), <strong class="calibre8">critically thinking, and asking key questions.</strong></p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">That’s it! Welcome to the new, better, faster, and more fun way of learning.</p>
<h4 class="h2">CLM: The Summary</h4>
<p class="noindent">CLM is easy to use, intuitive, and systematic. Anyone can use it, and the most successful students already do.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00033.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">Say goodbye to linear processing and hello to free-form learning. CLM allows you to readily consolidate information from multiple sources and look at it from multiple perspectives in a highly visual, interactive format. <a id="refr_3" class="calibre1"></a><a href="part0015.html#ref_3" class="nounder"><span class="superscript">3</span></a> Further, it allows you to process the information as you encounter it rather than waiting for all of the “puzzle pieces” to fall into place. This free-form learning allows the brain to merge logic and creativity to enable maximum learning.</p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">Every devoted student wants to think and learn better. CLM is a way to achieve both and more, as shown in the <strong class="calibre8">VERY IMPORTANT DIAGRAM</strong> below. The five phases and the four steps are summarized in the pages that follow this diagram.</p>
