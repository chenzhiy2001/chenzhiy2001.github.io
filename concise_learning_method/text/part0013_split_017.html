<p class="noindent"><small class="calibre4">A chemist’s primary interest, as described in Chapter 1, is the behavior of matter, but to understand the behavior of matter, we must first understand its internal structure. What are the internal differences between the granite of Half Dome in Yosemite, the olive oil added to your pasta sauce, and the helium in a child’s balloon? A simple model of the structure of matter will help us begin to answer this question.</small></p>

<p class="indent"><small class="calibre4">A <strong class="calibre8">model</strong> is a simplified approximation of reality. For example, architects often build a model of a construction project before actual construction begins. The architect’s model is not an exact description of the project, but it is still very useful as a representation of what the structure will be like. Scientific models are like the architects’ models; they are simplified but useful representations of something real. In science, however, the models are not always physical entities. Sometimes they are sets of ideas instead.</small></p>
<p class="indent1"><small class="calibre4">In the last hundred years, there has been a tremendous increase in our understanding of the physical world, but much of that understanding is based on extremely complicated ideas and mathematics. The application of the most sophisticated forms of these modern ideas is difficult, and not very useful to those of us who are not well trained in modern physics and high-level mathematics. Therefore, scientists have developed simplified models for visualizing, explaining, and predicting physical phenomena. For example, we are about to examine a model that will help you visualize the tiny particles of the solid metal in a car’s engine block, the liquid gasoline in the cars tank, and the gaseous exhaust fumes that escape from its tail pipe. The model will help you understand why <strong class="calibre8">solids</strong> have constant shape and volume at a constant temperature, why <strong class="calibre8">liquids</strong> have a constant volume but can change their shape, and why <strong class="calibre8">gases</strong> can easily change both their shape and volume. Our model of the structure of solids, liquids, and gases says that</small></p>
<p class="indenthanging1"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/> <small class="calibre4">All matter is composed of tiny particles. (We will start by picturing these as tiny spheres.)</small></p>
<p class="indenthanging2"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/> <small class="calibre4">These particles are in constant motion</small></p>
<p class="indenthanging2"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/> <small class="calibre4">The amount of motion is related to temperature. Increased temperature reflects increased motion.</small></p>
<p class="indenthanging2"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/> <small class="calibre4">Solids, gases, and liquids differ in the freedom of motion of their particles and in how strongly the particles attract each other.</small></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong class="calibre8">Solids</strong></p>
<p class="noindent"><small class="calibre4">Why does the metal in a car’s engine block retain its shape as you drive down the road while the fuel in the car’s gas tank conforms to the shape of the tank? What’s happening on the submicroscopic level when solid metal is melted to a liquid, and why can molten metal take the shape of a mold used to form an engine block? Our model will help us to answer these questions.</small></p>
<p class="indent"><small class="calibre4">According to our model, the particles of a solid can be pictured as spheres held closely together by strong mutual attractions. (Figure 2.1). All the particles are in motion, bumping and tugging one another. Because they’re so crowded and exert such strong mutual attractions, however, they only jostle in place. Picture yourself riding on particle 1 in Figure 2.1. An instant before the time captured in the figure, your particle was bumped by particle 3 and sent toward particle 5. (The curved lines in the figure represent the momentary direction of each particle’s motion and its relative velocity.) This motion continues until the combination of a bump from particle 5 and tugging from particles 2, 3, and 4 quickly bring you back toward your original position. Perhaps your particle will now head toward particle 2 at a greater velocity than it had before, but again, a combination of bumps and tugs will send you back into the small space between the same particles. A ride on any of the particles in a solid would be a wild one, with constant changes in direction and velocity, but each particle will occupy the same small space and have the same neighbors.</small></p>
<p class="indent"><small class="calibre4">When a solid is heated, the average speed of the moving particles increases. Faster-moving particles collide more violently, causing each particle to push its neighbors farther away. Therefore, an increase in temperature usually causes a solid to expand somewhat (Figure 2.1).</small></p>
