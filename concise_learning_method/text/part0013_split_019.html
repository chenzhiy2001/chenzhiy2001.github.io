<p class="noindent"><small class="calibre4">If any solid is heated enough, the movements of the particles become sufficiently powerful to push the other particles around them completely out of position. Look again at Figure 2.1. If your particle is moving fast enough, it can push adjacent particles out of the way entirely and move to a new position. For those adjacent particles to make way for yours, however, they must push the other particles around them aside. In other words, for one particle to move out of its place in a solid, all of the particles must be able to move. The organized structure collapses, and the solid becomes a liquid.</small></p>
<p class="indent"><small class="calibre4">Particles in a liquid are still close together, but there is generally more empty space between them then in a solid. Thus, when a solid substance melts to form a liquid, it usually expands to fill a slightly larger volume. Even so, attractions between the particles keep them a certain average distance apart, so the volume of the liquid stays constant at a constant temperature. On the other hand, because the particles in a liquid are moving faster and there is more empty space between them, the attractions are easily broken and reformed, and the particles change location freely. Eventually, each particle gets a complete tour of the container. This freedom of movement allows liquids to flow, taking on the shape of their container. It is this freedom of movement that allows liquid metal to be poured into a mold where it takes the shape of an engine block (Figure 2.2).</small></p>
