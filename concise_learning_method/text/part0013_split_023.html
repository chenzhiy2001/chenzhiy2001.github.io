<p class="indent"><small class="calibre4">The particles of a gas are much farther apart than in a solid or liquid. In the air around us, for example, the average distance between particles is about ten times the diameter of each particle. This leads to the gas particles themselves taking up only about 0.1% of the total volume. The other 99.9% of the total volume is empty space. In contrast, the particles of a liquid fill about 70% of the liquidâ€™s total volume. According to the model, each particle in a gas moves freely in a straight-line path until it collides with another gas particle or with the particles of a liquid or solid. The particles are usually with moving fast enough to break any attraction that might form between them, so after two particles collide, they bounce off each other and continue on their way alone.</small></p>
