<p class="indent"><small class="calibre4">Picture yourself riding on a gas particle at the instant captured in Figure 2.4. You are so far away from any other particles that you think you are alone in the container. An instant later, you collide with a particle that seems to have come out of nowhere. The collision changes your direction and velocity. In the next instant, you are again moving freely, as if your particle was the only one in the universe.</small></p>
<p class="indent"><small class="calibre4">Unlike the liquid, which has a constant volume, the rapid, ever-changing, and unrestricted movement of the gas particles allows gases to expand to fill any shape or volume of container. The movement also allows our cars’ exhaust gases to move freely out of the cars and into the air we breathe.</small></p>

<p class="paraspaceabove">3. Scientific models are like architects’ models; they are _____________ representations of something real.</p>
<p class="noindent">4. According to the model presented in this chapter, all matter is composed of tiny _____________.</p>
<p class="noindent">5. According to the model presented in this chapter, particles of matter are in constant _____________.</p>
<p class="noindent">6. According to the model presented in this chapter, the amount of motion of particles is proportional to _____________.</p>
<p class="noindent">7. Solids, gases, and liquids differ in the freedom of motion of their particles and in how strongly the particles _____________ each other.</p>
<p class="noindent">8. An increase in temperature usually causes a solid to _____________ somewhat.</p>
<p class="noindent">9. Particles in a liquid are still close together, but there is generally more _____________ between them than in a solid. Thus, when a solid substance melts to form a liquid, it usually _____________ to fill a slightly larger volume.</p>
<p class="noindent">10. The freedom of movement of particles in a liquid allows liquids to _____________, taking on the shape of their container.</p>
<p class="noindent">11. When a liquid’s temperature is higher, its particles are moving faster and are therefore more likely to _____________ from the liquid.</p>
<p class="noindent">12. The average distance between particles in a gas is about _____________ the diameter of each particle. This leads to the gas particles themselves taking up only about _____________ of the total volume. The other _____________ of the total volume is empty space. In contrast, the particles of a liquid fill about _____________ of the liquid’s total volume.</p>
<p class="noindent">13. According to our model, each particle in a gas moves freely in a(n) _____________ until it collides with another gas particle or with the particles of a liquid or solid.</p>
<p class="noindent">14. A liquid has a constant volume, but the _____________ movement of the gas particles allows gases to expand to fill a container of any shape or volume.</p>
<h5 class="h2">Chapter Problems</h5>
<p class="noindent">For each of the questions in this section, illustrate your written answers with simple drawings of the particles that form the structures of the substances mentioned. You do not need to be specific about the nature of the particles. Think of them as simple spheres, and draw them as circles.</p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">1. If you heat white sugar very carefully, it will melt.</p>
<p class="noindent">a. Before you begin to heat the sugar, the sugar granules maintain a constant shape and volume. Why?</p>

<p class="paraspaceabove">3. Ethylene glycol, an automobile coolant and antifreeze, is commonly mixed with water and added to car radiators. Because it freezes at a lower temperature than water and boils at a higher temperature than water, it helps to keep the liquid in your radiator from freezing or boiling.</p>
