<p class="image"><img src="../images/00096.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="noindent">If you’re like most students, you’re probably overwhelmed with information and, as a result, feel confused, unsure where to begin, and out of control. Simply hoping for the best by reading the material over and over again isn’t an effective strategy.</p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">It doesn’t have to be this way. In this chapter, I’ll show you how to regain control with CLM, the proven method that will make you a better learner and enable you to achieve better grades. It’s based on the premise that learning is a multi-phase process, in which you meaningfully organize and connect key concepts through visual maps, critically think, and ask key questions.</p>
<h3 class="h1"><a id="sec1-021" class="calibre1"></a>3.2 CLM: The Strategy</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the last few years, educational theory has been dominated by concepts such as “multiple intelligences” and “learning styles,” which I categorize as “learning components.” They all play a role in learning, some more than others, depending on the student.</p>
<p class="paraspaceabove">CLM is based on a holistic learning strategy and combines the most important learning components into one method. The great thing about CLM is that you can easily integrate whatever learning components work best for you into the way you use CLM. Here’s the summary of CLM. You may remember it, along with the general overview of CLM, from <a href="part0005_split_003.html#sec1-009" class="nounder">section 1.2.</a></p>
