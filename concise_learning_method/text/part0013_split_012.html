<p class="paraspaceabove"><strong class="calibre8">Key questions for the next phase:</strong></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">What else do you need to know to increase your understanding of the topic?</li>
<li class="calibre10">Can you apply what you have learned thus far?</li>
</ul>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><strong class="calibre8">Prepared for practice phase:</strong></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">You’ve now acquired and integrated additional concepts, revised the concepts and the framework as necessary, and, in turn, deepened your understanding and strengthened your memory.</li>
<li class="calibre10">Simply creating visual maps is not enough; you must be able to recreate them. You should be able to recall and explain the entire visual map that you’ve constructed. Be honest when testing yourself. You won’t do yourself any favors by failing to thoroughly reconstruct your map at this stage.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><strong class="calibre8">Learning:</strong></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">By actively identifying key concepts, organizing and connecting them using a visual map, critically thinking, and asking key questions, you’re efficiently and effectively learning.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h2">PRACTICE (Phase 4)</h4>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="underline"><strong class="calibre8">INPUTS</strong></span></p>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><strong class="calibre8">Sources of information:</strong></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">Existing knowledge on the topic (the visual map you prepared and refined in Phases 1–3).</li>
<li class="calibre10">Other tools and handouts that you will be allowed to use on your exam.</li>
<li class="calibre10">New problems solved under exam conditions. The new problems could come from the textbook (A3.2: review questions, chapter problems, and discussion questions), old exams, your teacher, the Internet, and your classmates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="underline"><strong class="calibre8">THE 4 REPEATING STEPS</strong></span></p>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><strong class="calibre8">Identify key concepts:</strong></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">In this phase, you’re essentially practicing what you’ll be expected to know and do on a course exam. In essence, you have to be able to apply the ideas and processes that you’ve learned in Phases 1–3.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><strong class="calibre8">Organize and connect key concepts in your visual map in a meaningful way:</strong></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">Update and revise your visual map immediately after learning something new from solving problems.</li>
<li class="calibre10">When you make mistakes, strive to understand why and revisit your visual map to see if you need to make changes in response to your inability to solve the problem correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><strong class="calibre8">Think critically:</strong></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">Does the problem make sense?</li>
<li class="calibre10">Have you solved a similar problem in the past?</li>
<li class="calibre10">What are the steps needed to solve this problem?</li>
</ul>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><strong class="calibre8">Ask key questions:</strong></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">What key concept is this problem testing?</li>
<li class="calibre10">Can you solve the problem with what you already know?</li>
<li class="calibre10">Do you need to update your visual map?</li>
<li class="calibre10">Is your visual map complete and accurate?</li>
</ul>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><span class="underline"><strong class="calibre8">OUTPUTS</strong></span></p>
<p class="paraspaceabove"><strong class="calibre8">Revised visual map:</strong></p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">This is your final version of the visual map before taking your exam.</li>
<li class="calibre10">Notice that the revised visual map has changed in a number of ways to reflect information gleaned from solving new problems.</li>
<li class="calibre10">Add unfamiliar concepts you’ve encountered while solving new problems, as I’ve done with “definition of matter.”</li>
<li class="calibre10">Add new concepts that you didn’t encounter in the text, such as the “effect of coolant on the freezing and boiling point of water” and “sublimation.”</li>
<li class="calibre10">Add new details that you thought were unimportant but which you encountered in the problems that you were solving, as I’ve done with “average distance between particles is about 10x diameter of each particle.”</li>
<li class="calibre10"><em class="calibre2">Notice how you’ve integrated almost 10 pages of textbook text and 10 PowerPoint slides into a one-page visual map!</em></li>
