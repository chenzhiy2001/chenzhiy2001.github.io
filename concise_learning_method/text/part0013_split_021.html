<p class="noindent"><small class="calibre4">If you’ve ever spilled gasoline while filling your car, you know how quickly the smell finds your nose. Our model can help you understand why.</small></p>
<p class="indent"><small class="calibre4">Picture yourself riding on a particle in liquid gasoline. Because the particle is moving throughout the liquid, it will eventually come to the liquid’s surface. Its direction of movement may carry it beyond the surface into the space above the liquid, but the attraction of the particles behind it will most likely draw it back again. On the other hand, if your particle is moving fast enough, it can move far enough away from the other particles to break the attractions pulling it back. This is process by which liquid is converted to gas. The coversion of liquid to gas is called <strong class="calibre8">vaporization</strong> or <strong class="calibre8">evaporation</strong> (Figure 2.3).</small></p>
<p class="indent"><small class="calibre4">You might also have noticed, while pumping gasoline, that the fumes smell stronger on a hot day than on a cold day. When the gasoline’s temperature is higher, its particles are moving faster and are therefore more likely to escape from the liquid, so that more of them reach your nose.</small></p>
